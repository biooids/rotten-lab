I'm now grinding Linux, Bash, C for systems fundamentals, Go as my professional language, Node.js and TypeScript for building products, PostgreSQL for data, Docker and Kubernetes for infrastructure, and Rust whenever low-level performance matters. Everything I learn now is aimed at becoming an exceptional backend and infrastructure engineer.",
